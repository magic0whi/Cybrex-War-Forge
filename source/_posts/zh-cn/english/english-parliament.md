## Sentence components

There are five basic sentence pattern:
1. Subject + Predicate
   e.g. The sun shinning
2. Subject + Copula + Predicative
   e.g. This is an English-Chinese dictionary
   e.g. The dinner smells good
3. Subject + Predicate + Object
   e.g. He enjoys reading
4. Subject + Predicate + Indirect object + Direct object
   e.g. He brought you a dictionary.
5. Subject + Predicate + Object + Object complement
   e.g. I often find him at work.
   e.g. They painted the door green.

Copula is a word or phrase used to link subject and predicate, e.g. `be`、 `seem`、 `appear`.

Predicative is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula(or linking verb). The most widely acknowledged predicative expressions are adjectives and nominals.

How to distinguish between Subject + Copula + Predicative and Subject + Predicate + Object?
in Subject + Predicate + Object, remove the Object, the sentence is still vaild.
so in Subject + Predicate + Object, Predicate must be intransitive verb (vt.)

## Three Clauses
