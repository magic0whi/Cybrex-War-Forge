## Sentence components

There are five basic sentence pattern:
1. Subject + Predicate(intransitive verb)
   e.g. The sun shinning
2. Subject + Predicate(Copula + Predicative)
   e.g. This is an English-Chinese dictionary
   e.g. The dinner smells good
3. Subject + Predicate + Object
   e.g. He enjoys reading
4. Subject + Predicate + Indirect object + Direct object
   e.g. He brought you a dictionary.
5. Subject + Predicate + Object + Object complement
   e.g. I often find him at work.
   e.g. They painted the door green.

Copula is a word or phrase used to link subject and predicate, e.g. `be`、 `seem`、 `appear`.

Predicative is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula(or linking verb). The most widely acknowledged predicative expressions are adjectives and nominals.
Predicative clauses after Copula `be` act as objects

How to distinguish between Subject + Copula + Predicative and Subject + Predicate + Object?
in Subject + Predicate + Object, remove the Object, the sentence meaning is still vaild.

## Three Clauses

### Attributive Clause(different with Appositive clause)

**Appositive clause** can replace the position of Object, Attributive can't

### Adverbial Clause

The Adverbial Clause modifies the purpose or time attribute or accompanying action of the predicate

### Nominal Clause

## Tenses

|                    | Present                                | Past (Predicate/Copule must be v2) | Future (+will after Subject)              | Past Future                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Simple             | Subject + Verb(v1)-s/es                | Subject + Verb(v2)                 | Subject + will/shall + Verb(v1)           | Subject + would + Verb(v1)                 |
| Continuous         | Subject + is/am/are + Verb(+ing)       | Subject + was/were + Verb(+ing)    | Subject + will/shall + be + Verb(+ing)    | Subject + would/should + be + Verb(v1)     |
| Perfect            | Subject + has/have + Verb(v3)          | Subject + had + Verb(v3)           | Subject + will + have + Verb(v3)          | Subject + would/should + have + Verb(v3)   |
| Perfect Continuous | Subject + has/have + been + Verb(+ing) | Subject + had + been + Verb(+ing)  | Subject + will + have + been + Verb(+ing) | Subject + would + have + been + Verb(+ing) |

## Non-finite verbs

Past Participles used as adjectives or perfect tense verb

Present Participle/Gerunds,
as Gerunds When functioning as subjects, objects, objects of prepositions, or subject complements
as Present Participle When used as adjectives or present tense verb.
Unlike a normal noun, a gerund can be modified by an adverb and take an object.
e.g. carefully painting the fence (Incomplete sentence)

"to do" or "to doing", that is the question:
When "to" as infinite marker, use "to do"
When "to" as preposition(**can add a noun. after "to"**), use "to doing"
e.g. Look forward to doing
